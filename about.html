        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>Hi there, my name is Thurein (pronounced: "the rain") and I'm a 16 year old junior just trying to survive high school and advance up to college. I was born on October 20, 2000 in a place called Mandalay, Myannmar, in Southeast Asia. I moved to America in 2006 and have lived in Las Vegas ever since. I grew up in the US and even though I can speak the Burmese language and it's my heritage, I'm basically more American than I am Burmese. Currently, I'm a student in the web design program at Southwest Career and Technical Academy. I always had good grades throughout my academic career and somehow I've still managed to mantain a 3.8 GPA. I joined the web design program because I thought computers were really cool when I was younger, but my thought process changed with age and now I plan to become a radiologist. I want to major in biology at either the University of Washington or the University of Reno and eventually get into med school.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>Growing up, I was always a nerd. I was the kid with the binders filled with trading cards, that watched anime and played video games in his room all day. I dropped the trading cards and anime as I grew up, but gaming stuck with me throughout the years and I still tend to game regularly as of today. I started out with consoles such as the PS1, PS2, and XBOX 360. When I was 10, my dad gave me a laptop as a suprise birthday present. Shortly after, I got addicted to a game called League of Legends and I've been playing PC games ever since. Besides gaming, I really enjoy playing basketball, watching movies, and listening to music. I'm a total Star Wars and Harry Potter geek. I'm really into rap and kpop. My favorite rapper has to a tie between Eminem and Kanye West, while my favorite Kpop group is BIGBANG. I would summarize myself as an ambitious young man who strives to be a doctor one day with an interest for games and music.</p>
