        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>What's up, my name is Thurein (pronounced: "the rain") and I'm a 16 year old junior just trying to survive high school and advance up to college. I was born on October 20, 2000 in a place called Mandalay, Myannmar, in Southeast Asia. I moved to America in 2006 and have lived in Las Vegas ever since. I grew up in the US and even though I can speak the Burmese language and it's my heritage, I'm basically more American than I am Burmese. Currently, I'm a student in the web design program at Southwest Career and Technical Academy. I always had good grades throughout my academic career and somehow I've still managed to mantain a 3.8 GPA. I joined the web design program because I thought computers were really cool when I was younger, but my thought process changed with age and now I plan to become a radiologist. I want to major pre med at either the University of Washington or the University of Reno and eventually get into med school.</p>
